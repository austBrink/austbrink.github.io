export const pitch = 'Majoring in mathematics was great, but actually getting my hands dirty making things (and getting jobs) isn\'t something you do when you prove infinite primes... Naturally, I took a break from university classes to teach myself how to code the web. I love it. I was a pretty head-in-the-clouds theoretical kind of person, but now, I\'m all about rolling up my sleeves and "making it happen". That means I\'m a happy web developer who\'s legitimately motivated to work hard making a great product while making everyone\'s life easier by leaving a documentation trail behind me. I\'m proficient as a full stack developer in the Reactjs, Nodejs, mySQL tech stack, but building applications at a junior developer level has only made me hungrier for more.';

export const quote = 'I love watching things continuously improve with persistence and effort. Getting to the final product just takes plain, old fashioned grit some days. The payout is that with each commit, the vision starts to become a reality. That appreciation is what makes me a patient math tutor, and it\'s what puts a smile on my face when I consolidate and document my code.';
